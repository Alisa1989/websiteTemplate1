                    I was born and raised in Florence, Italy in a three-language family which allowed me to be open to different cultures and perspectives. In 2016 I moved to the San Francisco bay area and was able to assimilate to the country and culture with ease. My experience in the diverse fields of service, legal, and tech are an example of my plasticity and my ability to adopt and implement new technologies.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    It always has been important for me to have clear goals in order to progress as effectively as possible. I apply this principle also in my work, always striving for captivating and responsive user interface, scalable and maintainable code, and a general curiosity in learning new tools to make these goals easier to achieve. Starting so many projects independently has taught me excellent time-management skills which are essential for a achieving goals.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    As much as I’ve enjoyed independent projects, working in a collaborative setting has taught me that no matter your skills and abilities it will always be necessary to join forces with other people to exchange expertise in order to deliver the best possible product. This is why I believe interpersonal skills are just as important as hard skills. My experience working across multiple industries, and on varying projects in college, gave me the ability to know what an organization’s strengths are and how to adapt to it’s vulnerabilities.
